# Simple Memory Game

The memory game was created as a recruitment task.

I have been interested in programming since secondary school. I'm currently a 2nd year student of computer science at the School of Management and Banking in Cracow. 
I completed a 9-month Java programming course at Software Development Academy, which included the following:

360 hours of intensive learning programming on Java and complementary tools & technologies

- Java (OOP, functional programming, algorithms and data structure)
- Project Patterns
- Graphics interfaces (Java FX / SWING)
- Development tools (Eclipse, IntelliJ)
- Scrum
- GIT
- Maven
- Java EE (RESTful WebServices),
- SQL, NoSQL
- JSP, Servlets
- Frameworks (Spring / Spring Boot / Hibernate, JDBC)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap framework 

Additionally, I'm learning from courses available on various portals like udemy.com.
I'm open to starting an internship or working as a junior developer so that I can grow in what I enjoy.
